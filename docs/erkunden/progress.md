## Phase 0 Entry

Date: 2026-07-01

Branch: `main`

Current HEAD at orientation time: `c7c28a62cc3f`

Scope:

- Read the SQLRooms Erkunden MVP specification.
- Read repository instructions, skills, README files, build files, existing docs and source patterns.
- Created `docs/erkunden/` scaffold.
- Recorded repository findings and baseline tests.
- Updated phase tracking in the Erkunden MVP specification.
- No product code implemented.

Repository findings:

- Package root is `ch.so.agi.datenportal`.
- The current application is server-rendered Spring Boot/JTE/HTMX with vendored static assets.
- Existing dataset detail route is `/datasets/{identifier}`.
- Future Explore route will be `/datasets/{datasetId}/explore`.
- Existing static assets are served from `src/main/resources/static` with explicit cache rules.
- No `package.json`, Vite config, TypeScript config or frontend lockfile exists yet.

Naming decision:

- Code and routes use English `explore`.
- UI text uses German `Erkunden`.
- No `/erkunden` alias is planned for the MVP unless explicitly requested later.

Baseline test evidence before Phase-0 documentation edits:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew test` | PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5s` |
| `./gradlew check` | PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 15s` |
| `./gradlew clean check` | PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 16s` |

Final verification after Phase-0 documentation edits:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew clean check` | PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 17s`; final rerun PASS, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 15s` |

Frontend test evidence:

- No separate frontend test command exists in Phase 0.
- Existing Playwright checks run through Gradle `playwrightTest` and are included in `check`.

Known limitations:

- SQLRooms, DuckDB-Wasm and React/Vite package compatibility has not yet been checked.
- CORS and Range Request behavior against real Parquet URLs has not yet been tested.
- CSP changes for Wasm/Worker/module assets are not yet known.
